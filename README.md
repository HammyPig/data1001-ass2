# data1001-ass1
This was the second project for the Foundations of Data Science course DATA1001. 

Initially being a group project, this was cut down to individuals as online classes took place. Unlike the first project, a dataset (about AirBNB) was an option given. 

This gave another approach which wasn't available before: dealing with another person's data (without pre-planning), and to still be able to manipulate it in such a way that gives some answer. 

Here I began to try delve deeper into R, as well as play around with interesting research questions and approaches, as I was somewhat experienced with the process, and did not have the constraints the first project experienced.
